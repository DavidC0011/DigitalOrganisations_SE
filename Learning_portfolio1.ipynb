what the dataset is about and might identify first insights on what ML Model might be the most applicable fot that certain task\n","- Plot the Data for visualization and deeper understanding\n","  - Helps to identify capped data, such as Price of smth doensn't go beyond certain X --> would manipulate the ML and lead to wrong forecasts\n","- Symmetrical data and more Bell shaped data over skewed right and skewed left data --> Apply Logarithm, it makes the curve more towards Gaussian distribution\n","\n","**Data Cleaning/Preparation**\n"," - handle missing values (e.g. with Imputation)\n","    - e.g. SimpleImputer() --> replaces missing values with the median, mean etc of the respective attribute\n"," - deal with categorical attribute\n","    - OrdinalEncoder() --> Convert text values as categorical attributes to numerical values, cause ML prefer to work with numerical values\n"," - deal with ordinal attribute (such as \"Slow\", \"medium\", \"fast\") --> ML will assume two nearby values are more similar to ea than to distant values\n","    - use OneHotEncoder to create one binary attribute per category (Only one attribute will than be equal to 1 (hot) while others are 0)\n","      - eg array([(0.,1.,0.)]) --> means \"Medium\" \n"," \n","Transformation Pipeline can be used to automate such tasks\n","- Apply Standardization(values are not restricted to specific range)\n","  - Less effected by outliers\n","- MinMaxScaling(values range from 0 to 1) to put numerical attributes on the same scale\n","- FunctionTransformer() --> Standardize values with np.log\n","- StandardScaler() --> \n","- Feature Scaling and Transformation\n","\n","- Split dataset into test and train set\n","\n","**Evaluation of ML model**\n","  - Cross-validation() --> Splits data into X nonoverlapping splits called \"Folds\"\n","    - then it trains and evaluates the model on those X splits\n","  - Apply Mean Squared error, R Squared Error, Median absolute error\n","  - Interpret those results\n","\n","**Fine Tune Model**\n","- Find good comination of hyperparamter values\n"," - examples of hyperparameters for Random Forest:\n","    - Number of decision trees in the forest\n","    - Maximum depth of each decision tree\n","\n","  - Grid SearchCV(), Random Search() --> to tune the hyperparameters\n","    - Hyperparameters are parameters to learned from the dataset but are set before training the model, they depend which model we choose \n","    - e.g. Logistic regression possible hyperparameters are \"tol\" and \"max_iter\""],"metadata":{"id":"FUviUIQ586aG"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["-----------------------------------------------------------"],"metadata":{"id":"WacQGVVj88nQ"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["####
